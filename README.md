# Week-2-Homework

For this homework we were required to use HTML and CSS to create a personal porfolio to showcase our current and future work. The criteria was as follows:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


# The Portfolio I created contains

* A HTML with semantic elements to show sections containing projects, contact info and personal info.
* A CSS file full of styling for the website and media queries for mobile screens.
* Hover functions on clickable elements.
* Links to a new tab for projects but only for Horiseon as it is the only project done to date.
